This project is a demo of the following project [MLOps End-To-End Machine Learning Pipeline-CICD](https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/mlops-end-to-end-machine-learning-pipeline-cicd-1a7907698a8e)
with some modifications.

The main objective of this project is to build and deploy a location image classifier using TensorFlow, Streamlit, Docker, Kubernetes, cloudbuild, GitHub, and Google Cloud. The main goal is to automate building and deploying machine learning models into production using CI/CD.

## Modification applied to this project:
1. Instead of predecting the class of an image located on an external storage, the code is changed in order to upload any images
2. The use of Github Actions to automate Kubernetes deployments
